I am a second year at the University of Washington majoring in 
Electrical and Computer Engineering.

Currently, I am interested in further exploring the intersection between
hardware and software.

This repository is part of my learning process in computer hardware skills
for my EE201 course. I am eager to learn and open to any advice and/or
recommendations. From this course, I hope to learn more about:
- Hands-on skills such as PCB boards and Arduino
- Applications of coding
